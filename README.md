This repository is the prove of our paper, which has been submitted for publication in Link.

### Model data
Please use the data in https://github.com/Lelvels/qsar_ml_find_hdac2_inhibitor/blob/main/data_for_modeling/train_test_data/HDAC2_train_test_data_final.xlsx

### Dependencies and implementation

You will need a working Python environment to run the code. The recommended way to set up your environment is through the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which provides the `conda` package manager. Anaconda can be installed in your user directory and does not interfere with the system Python installation. The required dependencies are specified in the file `*.yml` in the `env` folder. We recommened to run the command below in Linux operating system terminal.

Run the following command in the repository folder (where `env/*.yml` files is located) to create a separate environment and install all required dependencies in it:

```
conda env create -f my-rdkit-env.yml -n your_env_name
conda env create -f tmap-env.yml -n your_other_env_name
```

Then verify that the new environment was installed correctly:

```
conda env list
```

Our screening dataset was stored using PostgreSQL database, installation is availible in [PostgreSQL official website](https://www.postgresql.org/). The screening dataset is available in [this link (8GB after decompress)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YIhBD51oWA0s3p-egIHepNb3iZZbXqb1/view?usp=sharing). After imported the database, create a duplicate of file `env/env.example` and rename it to `.env`, then fill the database URL in the file.

```
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://<host_url>/<database_name>
```

### Project structures

- The source code are available in the src folder.
- The results of our work is in the results folder.

### Dataset location

- The train, test and validation data are available in the data_for_modeling/train_test_data folder
- The screening dataset is available in the data_for_modeling/screening_dataset, if you want the raw data from database, they are avalible in [this link (8GB after decompress)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YIhBD51oWA0s3p-egIHepNb3iZZbXqb1/view?usp=sharing).
